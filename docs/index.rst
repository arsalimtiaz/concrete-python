Concrete-python Documentation
=============================

Concrete-python is the Python interface to Concrete_, a
natural language processing data format and set of service protocols
that work across different operating systems and programming languages
via `Apache Thrift`_.  Concrete-python contains generated Python
classes, utility classes and functions, and scripts.  It does not contain the
Thrift schema for Concrete, which can be found in the
`Concrete GitHub repository`_.
